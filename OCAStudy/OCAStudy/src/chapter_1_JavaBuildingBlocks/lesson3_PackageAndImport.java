/* Wilcards
* You might think that including so many classes slows down your  program, but it doesn't.
* The compiler figures out what's actually needed.
* Using the wilcard can shorten the import list.
* java.lang is special in that it is automatically imported.
*/

/*
 * Example:
 * Files and Paths are both in the package java.nio.file.
 */

// 1. The shorter Ä±ne is to use wilcard to import both at the same time.
import java.nio.file.*;

// 2. The other choice is to import both classes explicitly.
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.nio.file.Files;

/*
 * IMPORTANT
 * 
 * import java.nio.*; // NO GOOD - a wilcard only matches class names, not "file.Files"
 * 
 * import java.nio.*.*; // NO GOOD - you can only have one wilcard and it must be at the end.
 * 
 * import java.nio.files.Paths.*; // NO GOOD - you cannot import methods, only class names.
 *
